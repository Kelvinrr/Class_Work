##Graphics :: Project 1

###Note to CS430 grader
This is my general class work repo, to see the graphics assignment, simply go to Graphics/Project_1/

The Project_1 directory has the code along with a tst_data directory with the images used to test my application and the Makefile to build it.

commands for making the application
build: make
clean: make clean

The arguments taken are exactly the same as mentioned in the project instructions. As I am not a graduate student, this only supports P3 and P6.
