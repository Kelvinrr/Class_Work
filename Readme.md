#Class Work

##Graphics :: Project 1

###Note to CS430 grader
This is my general class work repo, to see the graphics assignment, simply go to Graphics/Project_1/

The Project_1 directory has the code along with a tst_data directory with the images used to test my application and the Makefile to build it.
The arguments taken are exactly the same as mentioned in the project instructions.
